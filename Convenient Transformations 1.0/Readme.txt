Convenient Transformations 1.0

This submod aims to reduce micromanagement regarding transformations.

Some transformations that required item inputs have had those inputs replaced with a cash cost instead, determined based on the profit runts would have made selling grog instead of manufacturing the inputs. Forgone profit calculated based on Davy Jones sale prices (16.36 per runt hour), because that is what I play. 

Specific Changes:

-Nepotism: cannot be used multiple times on the same soldier
-Shakeup Ceremony: does not destroy worn armor. Costs 8680 instead of rope and moonshine
-Ritual of Rebirth: costs 2083 instead of moonshine.
-Educating Simple Minds: costs 673 instead of 500 and 1 handle
-Body Swap: does not destroy worn armor.
-Weirdgal transformation: does not destroy worn armor.
--NOTE: this may cause problems if used to put a weirdgal in armor she is not supposed to be able to wear.
-Repentence: does not destroy worn armor.
--NOTE: this may cause problems if used to put a repentia in armor she is not supposed to be able to wear.
